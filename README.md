# Z3dTickets

This repository contains a Discord bot for the Z3D community using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) with ticket and reaction role functionality.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new)
Use Railway's "Deploy from GitHub" option to deploy this repository. Railway will
prompt you for required environment variables such as `DISCORD_TOKEN` when you
deploy.

## ‚ú® Features

- Ticket system with open/close buttons
- Reaction role assignment
- Node.js using discord.js
- Web-based admin interface for reaction roles and debug


## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

- Install packages using `npm install`

- Set the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable (Railway prompts for it on deploy)

- Start the bot using `npm start` (or `node index.js`) and you'll be prompted
  for the token if the environment variable is unset
- Optional admin UI: `npm run admin` then visit <http://localhost:3000/admin>

## üìù Notes

This is a basic bot that relies on slash commands. For more details on extending the bot see the [discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome).
The Discord token should be configured as an environment variable (e.g. when deploying on Railway) and cannot be edited through the admin UI.
