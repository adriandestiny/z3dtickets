# Z3dTickets

This repository contains a Discord bot for the Z3D community using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) with ticket and reaction role functionality.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new)
Use Railway's "Deploy from GitHub" option to deploy this repository. Railway will
prompt you for required environment variables such as `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID` when you
deploy. **You must set these tokens in the Railway dashboard under the Variables/Environment tab.**

## ‚ú® Features

- Ticket system with open/close buttons
- Reaction role assignment
- Node.js using discord.js

## üë©‚Äçüíª How to use

- Install packages using `npm install`

- Set the `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID` environment variables in the Railway dashboard before deploying.

- Start the bot using `npm start`. You'll be
  prompted for the token if the environment variable is unset (for local development only).

If you change settings through the Discord setup commands, the bot will reload
the updated configuration automatically.

## üìù Notes

This is a basic bot that relies on slash commands. For more details on extending the bot see the [discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome).
The Discord token should be configured as an environment variable (e.g. when deploying on Railway) and cannot be edited through any web UI.
